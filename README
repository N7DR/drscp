    Program to generate custom SCP (super check partial) files
    
    drscp -dir <directory of contest logs> [-v] [-l cutoff-count] [-p parallel-number]
          [-tr call to trace] [-tl lower-limit] [-x] [-xpc %limit] [-i]
    
      -v            be verbose
      -l <n>        roughly, the number of times that a call must appear in the logs, even after
                    reasonable precautions have been taken to remove busts. Default 1.
      -p <n>        the number of directories to process simultaneously. Default 1.
      -tr <call>    provide detailed information on the processing of a particular logged call
      -tl <n>       do not automatically include entrants' calls unless they claim at least n QSOs. Default 1.
      -x            generate eXtended SCP output
      -xpc <n>      return only the top n% of most-frequently-seen calls. Default 100.
      -i            display erroneous QSO lines from logs on the standard error stream

Notes:
     
    If <directory of contest logs> begins with the commat character, then the value, without the
    leading character, is treaded as a file that contains a list of directories to process, one per line.
    
    <directory of contest logs> may list multiple directories, separated by commas.
    
    The -l limit is applied independently to each contest and band.
    
    Regardless of the value of -tl, entrants' calls must also appear in at least one other log.

    When using the -xpc option, a strict calculation of "top n%" might well fall in the middle of a number of calls
    with the same number of appearances. In this case, the output includes all calls that appear at least as often
    as the strict value of "top n%" might suggest.

    The reason for the word "roughly" in the description of the -l option is that considerable effort
    is taken by the program to remove calls before applying the -l limit.

The following examples were executed on my main desktop machine.

 1: ~/codelite/drscp/Debug/drscp -dir /zd1/public-logs/cq-ww/cq-ww-ssb-2022-logs

2: ~/codelite/drscp/Debug/drscp -dir /zd1/public-logs/cq-ww/cq-ww-cw-2022-logs -l 5
    Generates a standard SCP file based on the public logs for CQ WW CW 2022. Each
      call must appear (roughly) five times in the logs.
    Execution time: about 2 minutes.

3: ~/codelite/drscp/Debug/drscp -dir @/zd1/public-logs/dirs -x -p 3
  Generates an XSCP file based on the public logs named in the file /zd1/public-logs/dirs, processing
  up to three logs in parallel.
  Execution time: about 15½ minutes.
  Number of lines of output: 86,868
