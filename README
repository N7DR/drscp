    Program to generate custom SCP (super check partial) files
    
    drscp -dir <directory of contest logs> [-start <start date/time>] [-hrs <duration in hours>]
          [-v] [-l cutoff-count] [-p parallel-number]
          [-tr call to trace] [-tl lower-limit] [-x] [-i]
    
      -start        date/time of the start of the contest: YYYY-MM-DD[THH[:MM[:SS]]]
      -hrs          duration of the contest, in hours
      -v            be verbose
      -l <n>        roughly, the number of times that a call must appear in the logs, even after
                    reasonable precautions have been taken to remove busts. Default 1.
      -p <n>        the number of directories to process simultaneously. Default 1.
      -tr <call>    provide detailed information on the processing of a particular logged call
      -tl <n>       do not automatically include entrants' calls unless they claim at least n QSOs. Default 1.
      -x            generate eXtended SCP output
      -xpc <n>      return only the top n% of most-frequently-seen calls. Default 100.
      -i            display erroneous QSO lines from logs on the standard error stream
 
Notes:
    
    Each contest requires three values: the name of the directory holding the logs,
    the date/time of the start of the contest, and the contest duration, in hours
    
    If drscp is used to process a single contest, then the latter two values may be specified with the
    -start and -hrs parameters respectively.
    
    If <directory of contest logs> begins with the commat character, then the value, without the
    leading character, is treaded as a file that contains a list of space-separated directories,
    start times and durations to process, one contest per line. Examples appear below.
    
    The -l limit is applied independently to each contest and band.
    
    Regardless of the value of -tl, entrants' calls must also appear in at least one other log.
    
    When using the -xpc option, a strict calculation of "top n%" might well fall in the middle of a number of calls
    with the same number of appearances. In this case, the output includes all calls that appear at least as often
    as the strict value of "top n%" might suggest.

3: drscp -dir @/zd1/public-logs/dirs -x -p 3
  Generates an XSCP file based on the public logs named in the file /zd1/public-logs/dirs, processing
  up to three logs in parallel.
  Execution time: about 15 minutes.
  Number of lines of output: 89,075
