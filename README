     Program to generate custom SCP (super check partial) files
    
    drscp -dir <directory of contest logs> [-v] [-l cutoff-count] [-p parallel-number]
          [-tr call to trace] [-tl lower-limit] [-x]
    
      -v            be verbose
      -l <n>        roughly, the number of times that a call must appear in the logs, even after
                    reasonable precautions have been taken to remove busts. Default 1.
      -p <n>        the number of directories to process simultaneously. Default 1.
      -tr <call>    provide detailed information on the processing of a particular logged call
      -tl <n>       do not automatically include entrants' calls unless they claim at least n QSOs. Default 1.
      -x            generate eXtended SCP output
 
Notes:
     
    If <directory of contest logs> begins with the comat character, then the value, without the
    leading character, is treaded as a file that contains a list of directories to process, one per line.
    
    <directory of contest logs> may list multiple directories, separated by commas.
    
    The -l limit is applied independently to each contest and band.
    
    Regardless of the value of -tl, entrants' calls must also appear in at least one other log.
